In **AWS Cloud**, configuring **Load Balancers** also involves the concepts of **frontend** and **backend** services, though they are slightly different in naming and implementation compared to GCP. AWS offers several types of load balancers under the **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** service, including:

1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Best for HTTP/HTTPS traffic (Layer 7).
2. **Network Load Balancer (NLB)**: Best for TCP/UDP traffic at Layer 4.
3. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB)**: Supports both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP traffic (legacy).
4. **Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)**: For advanced use cases with virtual appliances.

The **frontend** service in AWS is typically referred to as the **Listener**, and the **backend** service is associated with **Target Groups**.

Here’s how you configure **Frontend and Backend services** in AWS Elastic Load Balancer:

---

### **Frontend Service in AWS Load Balancer**
The **Frontend** service in AWS is configured using **Listeners**, which define how the load balancer accepts incoming traffic.

#### Key Components of Frontend in AWS:
   - **Listener**: A listener checks for connection requests. It is defined by a **protocol** (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, TLS, etc.) and **port** (e.g., 80, 443).
     - **HTTP/HTTPS (ALB)**: For handling web traffic.
     - **TCP/UDP (NLB)**: For low-latency, high-throughput traffic.
   - **SSL Certificates (HTTPS)**: If you're using HTTPS listeners, you need to configure SSL certificates.
   - **Ports**: Each listener is associated with a port (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).

#### Example Setup (ALB – HTTP/HTTPS Listener):
1. **Create Listener**: A listener is created when you define your load balancer.
   - For HTTP, you typically set **port 80**.
   - For HTTPS, you set **port 443** and associate an SSL certificate.

In the **AWS Console**:
   - Go to **EC2** > **Load Balancers** > **Create Load Balancer**.
   - Choose **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
   - Under **Listeners**, select **HTTP** (port 80) or **HTTPS** (port 443).
   - If using HTTPS, upload an SSL certificate.
   
In **CLI**:
```bash
aws elbv2 create-listener \
    --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn> \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --default-actions Type=fixed-response,Message="OK"
```

### **Backend Service in AWS Load Balancer**
The **Backend** service in AWS is defined using **Target Groups**. A target group is a collection of backend resources (e.g., EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses) that receive traffic from the load balancer.

#### Key Components of Backend in AWS:
   - **Target Group**: Defines the backend resources and health checks.
     - Each target group is associated with a specific protocol (HTTP, HTTPS, TCP).
     - **Targets**: These are the backend resources, such as EC2 instances, IP addresses, or ECS containers, that are registered with the target group.
     - **Health Checks**: AWS performs health checks on targets to ensure only healthy instances receive traffic.
     - **Load Balancing Algorithm**: The default load balancing algorithm is **round-robin** (for ALB), but for NLB, you have a more direct forwarding.
     
   - **Health Check Configuration**: Specifies how to determine if the backend resources are healthy and able to serve traffic. You can set the protocol (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS) and the specific path or port.

#### Example Setup (ALB Backend):
1. **Create Target Group**: Define the target group, and configure the health check and port.
   - **Health Check Path**: Set a path like `/healthz` for HTTP health checks.
   - **Protocol**: Choose HTTP or HTTPS.
   - **Port**: Define which port on your target instances (e.g., port 80 for web servers).

In the **AWS Console**:
   - Go to **EC2** > **Target Groups** > **Create Target Group**.
   - Choose the **protocol** and **port**.
   - Add the **targets** (EC2 instances or IPs) to the group.

In **CLI**:
```bash
aws elbv2 create-target-group \
    --name my-target-group \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --vpc-id <vpc-id> \
    --health-check-protocol HTTP \
    --health-check-path /healthz
```

---

### **Connecting the Frontend (Listener) and Backend (Target Group)**
Once you have configured the **Listener** and the **Target Group**, you need to connect them so the traffic flows as expected.

1. **Associate Target Group with Listener**: After creating both the listener and the target group, you associate the listener with the target group.
   - When traffic is received on the frontend (Listener), it is forwarded to the backend (Target Group).

In **Console**:
   - Go to **Load Balancers** > **Listeners** > **View/edit rules**.
   - Edit the rules to forward traffic to the correct target group.

In **CLI**:
```bash
aws elbv2 create-listener-rule \
    --listener-arn <listener-arn> \
    --conditions Field=path-pattern,Values="/app/*" \
    --actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=<target-group-arn>
```

---

### **Example: Full Configuration (ALB - HTTP)**

1. **Create Target Group**:
```bash
aws elbv2 create-target-group \
    --name my-backend-group \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --vpc-id <vpc-id> \
    --health-check-protocol HTTP \
    --health-check-path /healthz
```

2. **Create Application Load Balancer (ALB)**:
```bash
aws elbv2 create-load-balancer \
    --name my-app-lb \
    --subnets <subnet-1-id> <subnet-2-id> \
    --security-groups <security-group-id> \
    --scheme internet-facing \
    --load-balancer-type application
```

3. **Create Listener**:
```bash
aws elbv2 create-listener \
    --load-balancer-arn <load-balancer-arn> \
    --protocol HTTP \
    --port 80 \
    --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=<target-group-arn>
```

4. **Register Targets with the Target Group**:
```bash
aws elbv2 register-targets \
    --target-group-arn <target-group-arn> \
    --targets Id=<instance-id-1> Id=<instance-id-2>
```

### Summary of Frontend and Backend Services in AWS Load Balancing:
- **Frontend Service (Listener)**:
  - Receives traffic from clients.
  - Configured via **Listeners**, which define the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS/TCP), ports (80/443), and SSL certificates for HTTPS.
  - For ALB and NLB, you can define listeners for specific traffic types (HTTP/HTTPS or TCP).
  
- **Backend Service (Target Group)**:
  - Defines the backend resources (EC2 instances, IP addresses, or containers).
  - Associates with health checks, load balancing methods, and the backend service configuration.
  - Traffic from the frontend listener is forwarded to healthy targets in the target group.

In AWS, after setting up your **Frontend (Listener)** and **Backend (Target Group)** services, traffic will flow from the client to the load balancer, which then forwards the traffic to the appropriate backend based on your configuration.
